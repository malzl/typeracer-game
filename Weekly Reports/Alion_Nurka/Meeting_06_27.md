# Was habe ich seit dem letzten Meeting gemacht (und wie lange habe ich gebraucht)?

- Provided basic network with Multiclient-server Architecture, containing a message broadcast function.
- Added following scenes:
    - client-view.fxml
    - server-view.fxml
- lobby-view.fxml
  as well as their corresponding controllers.
- ClientView
- ServerView
- LobbyView
- Committed additional functionality to the server application.
- Pair programmed with Nicolas Malz in order to connect the User Interface with the network.
- Each client notified when server sockets are closed.
- All resources are properly closed once the connection is terminated.
- Implemented new message type that notifies clients about the connection closure.
- Improved Server GUI, players can only start the server if the port number is valid.
- Contributed on setting up the demo project for the presentations on the 24th June.
- Collaborated with Bao, Nicolas and Julia to create the single-player game, mainly focusing on MVC development.
- In order to complete the lobby functionality, I had to wait for the network and main multiplayer scenes to be completed.

**Time spent: 12 hours**
- 8 hours invested on individual coding sessions,
- 2 on pair programming and
- 2 by collaborating and communicating with other team members.

# Was hat gut geklappt?
- A well functioning product for Singleplayer mode.
- Good grounds of code to work on the multiplayer and enrich it with features.
- Great state of project as a result of great collaboration with Bao, Nicolas and Julia.

# Wo gab es Probleme?
-  I saw the changes very late and had no information about the progress of the work other people were doing.
-  I also wish their work could be partitioned into smaller branches and commits, so I could understand the code better.

# Was werde ich bis zum n√§chsten Meeting machen?
- Will integrate my server improvements to the branch that contains the current functioning project.
- Will continue work on the lobby so that the game can start only if all players are ready.
- Will add chat functionality to the lobby, so that players can communicate with each other.
- If time remains, will add a countdown before the game starts.

# Was hat gut geklappt im Team? Oder gab es Probleme?
- We have a well functioning product.
- Very big commits.
