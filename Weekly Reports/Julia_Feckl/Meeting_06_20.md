# Was habe ich seit dem letzten Meeting gemacht (und wie lange habe ich gebraucht)?
Before the first tutor-meeting:
- Developed ideas for the game’s look and functionality.
- Assigned tasks: Taoyi and I focused on the GUI, Alion handled the server/client connection, and Andrew and Nicolas worked on game logic.
- Discussed additional features to include in the game.
- Created a Miro board (kanban style) with Nicolas to manage current ideas and tasks, providing an overview of our state and visualize our gitlap workflows.
  --> Time spent: about 2-3 hours (pair programming, working on my own)

From 13.06.2024 - 20.06.2024
- Based on Alion's server-client architecture, Taoyi and I drew the sequence diagram to visualize message handling.
- Collaborated with Bao, Nicolas, and Alion to create the single-player game, mainly focusing on MVC development.
- Developed a fundamental GUI for home screen, username input, text selection, and gameplay by creating controller classes and FXMLs.
- Added resources for GUI, such as images/icons.
- Created GUI mockups for initial screen ideas, incorporating a cohesive theme and additional features as animations, dark mode and sound
  --> Time spent: about 5-6 hours (calls, pair programming, working on my own)

# Was hat gut geklappt?
- Building the foundation of the single-player game was successful.
- Having a functional GUI that we can extend and present to the tutor and during the presentation.

# Wo gab es Probleme?
- Troubles with understanding the correct workflow and how to use GitLap within the group led to having lots of things locally.
- We had nearly too many ideas what made it hard to find the right compromises.

# Was werde ich bis zum nächsten Meeting machen?
- Prepare for the midterm presentation.
- Support the integration of multiplayer, especially in terms of GUI and MVC.

# Was hat gut geklappt im Team? Oder gab es Probleme?
- All in all we had every good communication and teamwork especially during the implementation of single player game.
- It was always respectful and harmonious.
- Established a solid foundation for implementing multiplayer and advanced features.
- Held calls and in-person meetings to support each other and advance the project.
