# Was habe ich seit dem letzten Meeting gemacht (und wie lange habe ich gebraucht)?
From 20.06.2024 until 27.06.2024
- together with Nicolas I prepared the demo for the midterm presentation
- for that we merged our finished single-player (v1.1) and unstable multiplayer game (v1.2)
- corrected merge conflicts
- practiced presentation and demo
- updating the project planning on Miro in kanban style
  --> Time spent: about 3-4 hours (calls, pair programming, working on my own)

- further improvement of the homescreen by adding more animations (these animations are part of my advanced features)
- Completed the multiplayer game with Bao and Nicolas, added GUI and controller classes for different game modes (single and multiplayer)
- and separated them and improved them already
- Started working on the GUI and controller class for the ranking screen
  --> Time spent: about 4-5 hours (calls, pair programming, working on my own)

# Was hat gut geklappt?
- We successfully created a great demo for the presentation and quickly agreed on what I would present.
- We have a nearly finished game that works and already and includes some advanced features (selecting different textes, creating a customized text, real-time updates, animation...)

# Wo gab es Probleme?
- Merging the two branches was challenging and took a lot of time.
- Attempting to add sound initially broke my home view, so I had to pause that task.

# Was werde ich bis zum n√§chsten Meeting machen?
- I want to improve the GUI for the starting screens (Home, Username-input, Server/Client, Lobby (together with Alion)).
- I will continue working on the ranking controller and FXML together with Taoyi.

# Was hat gut geklappt im Team? Oder gab es Probleme?
Good:
- We made significant progress.
- The presentation and demo went well.

Problems:
- We had a brief discussion about splitting up tasks and waiting for each other, but we resolved it well and collaborated efficiently.
