# Was habe ich seit dem letzten Meeting gemacht (und wie lange habe ich gebraucht)?
From 04.06.2024 until 11.07.2024

- Improved and redesigned all screens in light mode.
- Further developed a unified theme and style (same colors, fonts, font sizes, theme, etc.) and applied it to all screens.
- Added or exchanged pictures and animations to enhance user experience.
- Optimized the style.css for improved efficiency in switching from light to dark mode with Taoyi.
- Together with Taoyi and Nicolas, integrated dark mode for all screens.
- Improved and aligned the design in both light and dark modes.
- Updated the project planning on Miro using the Kanban style.
--> Time spent: about 20-25 hours (pair programming, working on my own).

# Was hat gut geklappt?
- We are progressing well towards completing the game and have added additional features and improvements.
- I am very happy with the current style of the game (light and dark mode now).

# Wo gab es Probleme?
- Some issues arose while developing and integrating dark mode, but we devised an elegant solution to implement it. (ThemeManager and dark.css)

# Was werde ich bis zum n√§chsten Meeting machen?
- We now need to complete the final steps including documentation, improving code style, finishing the ReadMe, and preparing the final demo.
- I will assist with upcoming tasks during these steps.
