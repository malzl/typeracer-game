# Was hat gut geklappt?
  What worked well?
  The logic of the single-player game is not very difficult, but integrating it with JavaFX presents some challenges. We have already learned a lot in Assignment 4, and additionally, there are many tutorials available online.

# Wo gab es Probleme?
  Did you have any problems?

# Was werde ich bis zum n√§chsten Meeting machen?
